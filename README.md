##  Example Lotus application structure

This is an example structure for a [lotus](https://github.com/lotus/lotus) web application.

This skeleton was extracted from sidonath's [room reservation app](https://github.com/sidonath/room-reservation) which
was the first known lotus application.  The only changes I made were to use minitest over rspec, and I also implemented
the structure proposed by [Jodosha](https://github.com/jodosha) in the lotus.rb chat room.
